# Things I forget ...

# file permissions
  ls -l, alternative is exa

# and the change for exec
  chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx testRes.sh

# find my ip address
  hostname -I   #local
  https://whatismyipaddress.com #public

# local web server
  cd ~/../CVBuilder$ ls
  python3 -m http.server

# start page in default browser (see local web server)

# where am I in the tree?
  pwd

# new installation tips
  https://itsfoss.com/things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu-24-04/
  Ubuntu unrestricted extras
  Aptitude
  brew

# find
  fzf - like grep some like it better

# help
  tldr - man pages but to the point

# peek
  bat - view file contents
  instead of cat, via homebrew
  appears not be a ppa

# task manager
  btop - memory - sysmon on steriods
More usable than htop or top

# properties
  fastfetch
  neofetch

# diskspace
  dust - visual file space usage in the shell
  QDirStat - GUI - I like better than Disk Usage Analyzer
